# Legacy package references

This directory contains the original `packages/data` and `packages/macro_events` code exported from git HEAD for reference only.

- Not used at runtime; the active implementation lives in `src/fomc`.
- Do not import from here or reinstall these modules.
- Safe to delete if you no longer need to compare with the legacy version.
